# Rust Secure Code Working Group

This repository is the central [issue tracker] used by the Secure Code WG to
coordinate efforts towards promoting secure code development in Rust.

[issue tracker]: https://github.com/rust-secure-code/wg/issues

## Mission

Our mission is to make it easy to write secure code in Rust.

We have the following goals for the Rust language and ecosystem:
- Most tasks shouldn't require dangerous features such as `unsafe`. This includes FFI.
- Mistakes in security code should be easily caught by machines or, failing
  that, humans aided by machines.
- It should be clear to programmers how to perform security-sensitive tasks.
- Security-critical code which is relied on by Rust programmers should be bug
  free.
